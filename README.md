# Welcome to the Future of Clinical Trials

I'm Tengu Muna ‚Äî a **Global Clinical Operations Strategist** and **Afrofuturistic Digital Artist** who‚Äôs spent decades navigating the complexities of clinical research across continents.

After witnessing firsthand how clinical trial operations are slowed down by outdated systems, excessive red tape, and generic spreadsheets, I decided to do something radical:

‚öôÔ∏è Although I come from a non-coding background, I taught myself to code using OpenAI tools like ChatGPT and Codex, and simultaneously immersed myself in learning GitHub. Every tool I‚Äôve released reflects my commitment to practical, elegant solutions that solve real problems across the clinical research lifecycle.

These are **real-world**, AI-assisted tools for **study-level trial management**, built from the lens of someone who‚Äôs led global studies, managed sites, collaborated with CROs, and lived the bottlenecks.

I'm now expanding into tools specifically designed for **site operations**‚Äîto empower study coordinators, site managers, and investigators with intuitive systems that simplify complexity.
